- 👋 Hi, I’m @caedees
- 👀 I’m interested in embedded and blockchain programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning pretty much everything connected to system programming and C/C++/Rust langs
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on doing crazy things (there's lots of 'em)
- 📫 Yet you can't reach me 'cause I'm not ready for prod programming yet
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I eat pickles
